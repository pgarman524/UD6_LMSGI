  <<Important!>> Read the terms and conditions of this license agreement
  (hereafter "Agreement") carefully before using Qizx/db Engine
  (hereafter "Software"). Use of the Software implies
  acceptance of this Agreement, and legally binds you and/or your company
  (hereafter "Licensee"), and Pixware SARL (hereafter "Licensor"), to the
  terms and conditions set forth below.

Grant of License
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor hereby
  grants to Licensee a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to install
  and use the Software solely for Licensee's internal business purposes.

* Installation and use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Licensee may only install the Software on host machines located at a single
  site, where a site is defined as a geographical area demarcated by a 50-mile
  radius circle around some reference point.
  This reference point must be a facility that belongs to Licensee or
  to an organization that provides hosting services to Licensee.
  In the former case, the Software may be installed on any number of
  Licensee's host machines within the site boundaries, used by any number of
  Licensee's employees, and accessed by any number of Licensee's applications.
  In the latter case, the Software may be installed on any number of
  the service provider's host machines within the site boundaries,
  and accessed by any number of Licensee's applications.

  Licensee may modify any part of the Software for which source code
  is provided, however such action frees Licensor from any further
  technical support to Licensee.

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Software is copyrighted and title to all copies is retained by Licensor.
  Licensee may not make copies of the Software, other than a single copy for
  archival purposes. Licensee may, for its internal use only, print copies of
  the documentation of the Software, in which event all proprietary rights
  notices on the Software shall be reproduced and applied. Except as stated in
  section 1, Licensee may not modify, decompile, or otherwise reverse engineer
  the Software.

  The Software is not designed or licensed for use in on-line control
  equipment in hazardous environments such as operation of nuclear facilities,
  aircraft navigation or control, or direct life support machines.

  The Software is confidential and proprietary information of Licensor.
  Licensee agrees to protect the Software from unauthorized use or disclosure.

Warranty Disclaimer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Licensor does not warrant that the Software will meet Licensee's
  requirements or that the Software is error-free. Except as specified in this
  Agreement, Licensor expressly disclaims all warranties, express or implied,
  with respect to the Software, including, but not limited to, warranties of
  merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.

Limitation of Liability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  In no event shall Licensor be liable to Licensee or a third party for any
  lost revenue, profit or data, or for any indirect, special or consequential
  damages, however caused and regardless of theory of liability, arising out
  of the use of or inability to use the Software, even if Licensor has been
  advised of the possibility of such damages.

Termination
~~~~~~~~~~~

  This license is effective from the date purchased by Licensee and is
  perpetual unless terminated by Licensee's election or by breach of this
  Agreement. Licensee may terminate this license at any time by destroying all
  copies of the Software, including any documentation. This license will
  terminate immediately without notice from Licensor if Licensee fails to
  comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Licensee must
  destroy all copies of the Software, including any documentation.

Entirety
~~~~~~~~

  This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of agreements between
  Licensee and Licensor relating to the Software. It supersedes all prior
  agreements and understandings, and prevails over any conflicting or
  additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgement, or similar
  communication between the parties before or during the term of this
  Agreement. It may be modified only in writing signed by both parties.

  This Agreement is made under, shall be governed by and construed in
  accordance with the French law.
