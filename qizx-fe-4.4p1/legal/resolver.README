<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The resolver class implements the full semantics of OASIS
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/html/a401.htm">Technical
Resolution 9401:1997 (Amendment 2 to TR 9401)</a> catalogs and
the 06 Aug 2001 Committee Specification of OASIS
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/spec-2001-08-01.html">XML
Catalogs</a>.</p>

<p>It also
includes a framework of classes designed to read catalog files in
a number of formats:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The plain-text flavor described by TR9401.
<li>The <a href="http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/XCatalog.html">XCatalog</a>
XML format defined by John Cowan
<li>The XML Catalog format defined by the OASIS
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/">Entity Resolution
Technical Committee</a>.
</ol>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<p>The <a href="com/sun/resolver/tools/package-summary.html">tools
classes</a> provide "out-of-the-box" SAX1 Parser, SAX2 XMLReader,
and JAXP URIResolvers. If you're just interested in hooking a
parser or URI resolver into your application, this is the place to start.
</p>

<p>The XP and XT packages show how these resolvers can be plugged into
XP and XT.</p>
